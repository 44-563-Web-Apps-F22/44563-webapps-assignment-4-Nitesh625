            RUD.  Come hither, all you people—
            When you hear the fearful news,
      All the pretty women weep'll,
            Men will shiver in their shoes.

LUD.  And they'll all cry "Lord, defend us!"
      When they learn the fact tremendous
            That to give this man his gruel
            In a Statutory Duel—

BOTH.       This plebeian man of shoddy—
            This contemptible nobody—
                  Your Grand Duke does not refuse!
                 

(During this, Chorus of men and women have entered, all trembling
      with apprehension under the impression that they are to be
      arrested for their complicity in the conspiracy.)

CHORUS.

      With faltering feet,
                              And our muscles in a quiver,
      Our fate we meet
                              With our feelings all unstrung!
      If our plot complete
                              He has managed to diskiver,
      There is no retreat—
                              We shall certainly be hung!
                              <br>

LUD.  (aside to RUDOLPH).
      I've several epithets that I've reserved for you
            exclusively.
      A choice selection I have here when you are ready to begin.

RUD.  Now you begin

LUD.        No, you begin—

RUD.              No, you begin—

LUD.                    No, you begin!

CHORUS (trembling).
            Has it happed as we expected?
            Is our little plot detected?

DUET—RUDOLPH and LUDWIG

RUD.  (furiously).
      Big bombs, small bombs, great guns and little ones!
                        Put him in a pillory!
                        Rack him with artillery!

LUD. (furiously).
      Long swords, short swords, tough swords and brittle ones!
                        Fright him into fits!
